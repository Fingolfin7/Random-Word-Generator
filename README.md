# Random-Word-Generator
A program that generates random strings and checks for real words.

The program generates a number of random strings and checks them against a list of the 10 000 (or 20 000) most used english words, which I got from this repository https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english by Josh Kaufman (https://github.com/first20hours)

The program allows for pure random string generation or semi-random generation. Semi-random generation allows the user to determine the "max vowel count". The program will generate a large number of strings determined by the user It also allows for users to filter an array of valid words with a minimum word length variable. 

A list of valid/real words and shows the percentage of total strings generated:
